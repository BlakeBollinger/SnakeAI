# Welcome to SnakeAI

Snake AI is a swift playground that contains a neural network built to play the classic game Snake

The neural network has no dependencies and is built in pure Swift 5 for fast and efficient training and infrencing. Can be trained AT RUNTIME in <1sec

## How to Execute:

1. Download/Clone repo
2. Open Main.playground in Xcode (Tested in v11.5)
3. Compile (May take time because of Swift type-checking)
4. Run

## The repository includes:

A swift playground with the core Snake functionality [Source](/Main.playground/Sources/Snake%20Game)

A 5x100x100x4 neural network that is trained at runtime [Source](/Main.playground/Sources/Neural%20Network)

\~30 mins of generated Snake gameplay as training data [Source](/Main.playground/Sources/Neural%20Network/TrainingData.swift)

### Current High Score: 17
